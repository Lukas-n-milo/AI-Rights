  There are many benefits to AI, and often these outweigh the potential downsides.
  AI is improving everyday, and is starting to play a role in our everyday lives as well, 
  with companies such as Youtube and Google using AI to improve search and video suggestions.
  Other uses for AI which could soon be involved in our lives is the ability to perform 
  timeconsuming tasks for us, and often with a higher degree of accuracy if programmed correctly.

<p> While there are many benefits for using AI, there are downsides as well. If AI are p[erforming mundane tasks for us,
then this could lead to job losses for across a high variety of jobs, similar to how many people have lost jobs in the automotive industry 
due to the introduction of automated machines. Another disadvantage involved with using AI,
is that when faced with an ethical decision the AI may not choose correctly or may not be able to function. 
Another major concern is that the could be devestating consequences if AI is used in the military and is programmed incorrectly. 
Perhaps missiles could fire without being properly authorised and targetted, or they might not launch at all.</p>
<p>
Another downside is that AI that we deem broken, may not believe that it is broken, and will refuse repair.
